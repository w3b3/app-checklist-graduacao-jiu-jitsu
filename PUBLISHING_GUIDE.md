## üöÄ Steps to Publish TODAY

### Step 1: Test the App (5-10 minutes)

Your Expo dev server is running. In your terminal window (not browser), you should see:
- A QR code
- Or a URL like `exp://127.0.0.1:8081`

**To test:**
1. Open **Expo Go** app on your phone (install from App Store/Play Store if needed)
2. Scan the QR code from your terminal
3. App will load on your phone
4. Test: Check boxes, switch belts, add notes, complete a belt

**If you don't see a QR code**, press `r` in the terminal to reload.

---

### Step 2: Create App Icon (10-15 minutes)

You need a **1024√ó1024px** icon. Simple options:

**Option A - Use Canva (Free):**
1. Go to canva.com
2. Create "App Icon" template (1024√ó1024)
3. Use BJJ belt colors or simple gi/belt graphic
4. Export as PNG

**Option B - Use Figma (Free):**
1. Create 1024√ó1024 frame
2. Add circle with belt color gradient
3. Add text "BJJ" or belt graphic
4. Export as PNG

**Option C - Ultra Simple:**
Create a solid color square with the word "BJJ" in white text.

**Save as:**
- `assets/icon.png` (1024√ó1024)
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` (same file for Android)

**Then update app.json:**
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#1E40AF"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Install EAS CLI and Login (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install EAS globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to your Expo account (create one if needed - it's free)
eas login

# Link project
eas build:configure
```

This creates an Expo account if you don't have one. **It's free** - you don't pay Expo anything.

---

### Step 4: Update app.json with Store Info (5 minutes)

```bash
# Edit app.json and add:
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "BJJ Checklist - Gradua√ß√£o",
    "slug": "bjj-checklist",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.brothersfight.bjjchecklist",
      "buildNumber": "1"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.brothersfight.bjjchecklist",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#1E40AF"
      }
    },
    "privacy": "unlisted"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 5: Build for iOS and Android (30-45 minutes - happens in cloud)

```bash
# Build both platforms at once
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Or build separately:
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What happens:**
- Builds happen on Expo's servers (not your Mac)
- Takes 20-30 minutes per platform
- You'll get download links when done
- **iOS**: You get an `.ipa` file
- **Android**: You get an `.aab` file

**Wait for builds to complete before next step.**
